//*******                        Be sure to update resource.rc!


// Version history
// 2.0.16b0: Look for GNUPLOT_BIN in environment if not specified in input file.
//         Initialize nominal focus at -zdistance, but invert it to positive if scan phase is inverted.
//         Create output dir if not exists.
// 2.0.15: When using pointingOption::ACTUAL, use the weighted average of the pol0, pol1 beam direction in the phase fit model.
//         Moved call to calcCenterOfMass() from ScanData::AnalyzeBeams() to ScanSet::loadScan() so both pols are precomputed before the first call to FitPhase.
// 2.0.14: FitPhase: ftol=1.19e-7, reduceSubReflector=true for first pass, no z linear searches
// 2.0.13: Rotate xtics in plots.  FitPhase instrumented to make surface plots of eta_phase around the phase center.
//         Print error message if a file can't be loaded.   Fix NF axis units 'mm'
// 2.0.12: Fix bug when using reduced subreflector, but that code is disabled in this version.
//         Prints all steps of the phase center search to stdout.
//         Only makes unwrapped phase plots if "[settings] unwrapphase=1"
//         Fix bug in NF axis tics.
// 2.0.11: Unwrap FF phase defaults to false if not specified with "[settings] unwrapphase=1"
//         Added version resource for Windows.
// 2.0.10: Unwrap FF phase before phase fit; use a reduced subreflector mask for the first pass of phase fit.
//         ScanDataRaster: store phase in radians, not degrees.
//         Added plot_copol_ffphase_unwrap and plot_copol_ffphase_model to output file.
// 2.0.9:  Removed outputs shift_from_focus_mm, subreflector_shift_mm, and defocus_efficiency_due_to_moving_the_subreflector.
//         Their calculation method was broken and of dubious value.
// 2.0.8:  Display actual pointing angles on the pointing plot.
//
// 2.0.7:  Added input file option [settings] invertphase with options {lsb, usb, all, none}
//         and synonyms {yes, y, t, 1} for all, {no, n, f, 0} for none.  All options case-insensitive.
// 2.0.6:  Using multi-pass search with exact expression for fitted phase:
//         1) CG search from {0, 0, probe-zdistance}
//         2) Line search along delta_z
//         3) CG search, line search, final CG search
//         Fix calculation error in squint_percent
// 2.0.5:  Using exact expression for fitted phase including corrections from Alvaro Gonzalez
//         Invert phase and rotate for LSB now.
//         Invert signs of nominal pointing angles.  Matches scanner coord system now.
//         Added makePhaseFitPlot for visualizing the fitted phase surface.
//         Improved documentation of FitPhase and ScanDataRaster::calcPhaseEfficiency
// 2.0.4:  Don't rotate nearfield scans but do invert phase when appropriate.
//         Back to el = +2.48 for band1test dewar
// 2.0.3:  Adjust labels on pointing angles plot
// 2.0.2:  Added makefile and minor fixes for compilation on Linux
// 2.0.1:  Name pointing angle plots for RF if scanset_id not provided
//         Name [results_xx] section for RF if scanset_id not provided
//         Use el = -2.48 for band1test dewar
//         Calculate squint even when 180-degree scan for correcting probe asymmetry is not provided.
//         For backwards compatibility with LabVIEW wrapper, squint results in output section for pol1, copol.
// 2.0.0:  First release of BeamEff2 C++
